# Introduction to Burp Suite

**Burp Suite** is a toolkit for web application security testing. It acts as an intercepting proxy between your browser and the target application so you can observe, modify, and replay HTTP/S traffic.

## Editions
- **Community (Free):** Core proxy, Repeater, basic Intruder, Decoder, Comparer, Sequencer.
- **Professional (Paid):** Adds automation, vulnerability scanning, advanced Intruder features, extensions, and productivity upgrades.

## Typical Workflow
1. Configure your browser to use Burp's proxy.
2. Explore the app normally; Burp records traffic.
3. Use **Repeater** to edit and re-send interesting requests.
4. (Optional) Use **Intruder** for simple payload fuzzing on local labs.
5. Review findings and document responsibly.
