# Tips & Tricks

- **Scope**: Set target scope so Burp focuses on your **local** labs only.
- **Logger** (or HTTP history): Great for auditing requests after a session.
- **Shortcuts**: Right-click context menus are your friend (Send to Repeater/Intruder/Decoder).
- **Notes**: Create a `findings.md` for your observations; attach screenshots from `images/`.
