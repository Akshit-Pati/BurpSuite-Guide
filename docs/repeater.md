# Repeater

**Repeater** lets you edit and resend captured requests and compare responses.

## Workflow
1. In **Proxy → HTTP history**, right-click an interesting request → **Send to Repeater**.
2. Go to **Repeater**, edit headers/params/body as needed.
3. Click **Send** and review the response status, headers, and body.
4. Note differences as you change inputs (e.g., search terms).

## Practice
- With **Juice Shop** running, intercept a search request and replay it in Repeater while changing the search query parameter.
